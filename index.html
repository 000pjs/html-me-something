            "Don't say you're sorry... " Fig narrows her eyes at me as she cracks 2 eggs into the frying pan.
            "Don't. ..start with ME! -- (lit with euphoric candor) -- Go downstairs and grab the laundry and then grab the water jug from the car." 
            I sigh and move toward the backdoor, quiet and happy, placing my hand on her shoulder for a moment, 
            then ruffling the ears of a greying 100 lb dog. She's waiting to be fed, her name is Barbie. The smell of broccoli, eggs and rice 
            fill the small apartment.  As I head downstairs to street level, big, fat raindrops are plodding on the windows, sounding like a steel factory and it's cool.
            I stand in the backdoor-way watching the trees sway. <br>
            <br>
            Just then I hear a man scream in anger.  "Fuuuuccckk!!!" It's loud enough for the entire block to hear.  I peak around a brick building to the alleyway, and I see 
            a young down-and-out buzz cut man rifling thru the trash in front of a neighboring unit.  He's screming his lungs out.  Before I can register
            a black sedan pulls up. Two men get out, bag his head and stuff him inside. As they pull off, a woman is reavealed and she starts walking toward me.  
            She flashes a concerend smile and says, "You didn't see anything this evening."  And I say "I didn't see
            anything this evening," as I turn around and return to the apartment.<br>
            <br>
            3 days have passed and I wake from a an unexpected nap, and it's mid-afternoon.  Eyes still blurry and fat with allergy tears, bringing streaks of 
            light in through the window like a wash of watercolors -- yellows, blues and greens.  Old gingko-looking leaves are shifting and dancing together perfectly.  
            Fig and Barbie are asleep next to me, twitching with the R.E.M.s. Light pours in and the room evapoates.
